`Python Data Analysis Tutorial.ipynb` is the Jupyter Notebook in which the data analysis tutorial will be conducted. The notebook should take under 1.5 hours to deliver orally (~1h 23m by RR's timing).

Note: Notebook(s) were developed in a dark jupyter notebook theme. Hence, viewing them in the default, white/bright theme will make some things and particularly visualizations difficult or outright impossible to decipher.
