`Python Data Analysis Tutorial.ipynb` is the Jupyter Notebook in which the data analysis tutorial will be conducted. The notebook should take about 1.5 hours to deliver orally. Note: this version of the notebook was developed in a dark jupyter notebook theme. Hence, viewing them in the default, white/bright theme will make some things and particularly visualizations difficult or outright impossible to decipher. If you want a version of the notebook appropriate for a light theme, see `Python Data Analysis Tutorial -- Light theme.ipynb`.
