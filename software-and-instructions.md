### Data analysis with Python

In this workshop led by Russell, you will get a quick, high-level introduction to data analysis in Python. We will cover the following Python tools:

1. [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live (Python) code and code output, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. They are a very flexible, powerful tool for doing reproducible #openscience.
2. The [pandas](pandas.pydata.org) library, used for representing and manipulating tabular data structures (e.g., data in csv's or Excel spreadsheets).
3. [Seaborn](seaborn.pydata.org), a data visualization library that allows generating both basic plots (bar plots, scatter plots) and more advanced plots (violin plots, heatmaps) a breeze.
4. [Scipy.stats](seaborn.pydata.org) and/or [statsmodels](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/), libraries with common statistical functions and tests in the general(ized) linear model and beyond.

We may explore 1-4 using data similar to that generated by Monica's PsychoPy experiments, or data from PSYC5104 HW sets, or something else entirely.

## Installation and setup for Python sessions

1. [Anaconda Python 3.5](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), which contains the Jupyter Notebook which Russell's session will use.
    1. Follow [this link](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), and then click the icon for your computer's OS. You want Python 3.5. For Mac, you will probably find it easier to use the graphical installer. (For Windows, it appears you can only install via graphical installer!)
    2. Once you install Anaconda, if you open a terminal (Mac) or cmd prompt (Windows) and type `python --version`, the terminal/cmd-prompt should you should see 'Anaconda' somewhere in the output.
    3. If you type `jupyter notebook` from the terminal/cmd-prompt, a tab with a file explorer interface should open in your default web browser. If you click 'New' in the upper-right, you should see an option for 'Notebook -- Python [root]'. If you click that, a new jupyter notebook should open in a new tab. Russell's session will be conducted in one of these.
2. A code-oriented text editor / IDE (text editor **!=** word processor), preferably with Markdown support, such as [Atom](https://atom.io) (Rachael's recommendation), [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Gedit](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit), Spyder (included with Anaconda), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), or [Vim](http://www.vim.org/). You will use a text editor / IDE for Rachael's portion.
3. [PsychoPy](www.psychopy.org). To install PsychoPy, first install the Anaconda distribution of Python in step 1, and then do the following:
    1. Open a terminal (Mac) or cmd prompt (Windows) and type `conda create -n psychopy-tutorial --channel https://conda.anaconda.org/CogSci psychopy pyglet wxpython python=2.7`. That should be all one line. This will (1) create a Python 2.7 'environment' on your machine, and (2) install PsychoPy and its dependencies (required packages/libraries) to that environment.
    2. To activate this new environment when you want to work with PsychoPy, type `source activate psychopy-tutorial` (Mac) or `activate psychopy-tutorial` (Windows).
    3. You should now be able to run a psychopy script in the current working directory with `python <psychopy-filename.py>` (replacing `<psychopy-filename.py>` with the actual filename!).
    4. To deactivate this environment and return to the default Python 3.5 environment installed by Anaconda (so you can work on Rachael's and Russell's sessions, for example), type `source deactivate` on Mac and `deactivate` on Windows.
