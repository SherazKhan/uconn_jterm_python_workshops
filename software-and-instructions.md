### Data analysis with Python

In this workshop led by Russell, you will get a quick, high-level introduction to data analysis in Python. We will cover the following Python tools:

1. [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live (Python) code and code output, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. They are a very flexible, powerful tool for doing reproducible #openscience.
2. The [pandas](pandas.pydata.org) library, used for representing and manipulating tabular data structures (e.g., data in csv's or Excel spreadsheets).
3. [Seaborn](seaborn.pydata.org), a data visualization library that allows generating both basic plots (bar plots, scatter plots) and more advanced plots (violin plots, heatmaps) a breeze.
4. [Scipy.stats](seaborn.pydata.org) and/or [statsmodels](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/), libraries with common statistical functions and tests in the general(ized) linear model and beyond.

We may explore 1-4 using data similar to that generated by Monica's PsychoPy experiments, or data from PSYC5104 HW sets, or something else entirely.
